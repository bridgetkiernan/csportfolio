            <h1 class="sub-title">What did I create?</h1>
                <p class="ht">
                    I created a web page that shows a introduction to how I am, and some pictures. I also created a list of a few of my 
                    favorite things. Futher down on the page I explain some specific stuff I leanerd and then a table with a list in shows
                    some of the HTML tags and CSS declrations I learned and have been using.

            <div class="para-b">
            <h1 class="sub-title">How does the project work overall?</h1>
                <p class="ht">
                The web page that I created uses HTML and CSS to create the text, images, sections, and tables on the page. 
                I used HTML headers, pargraph, and lists to create the text on the page. The varation of use the tags H1, H2, etc. allowed me to size 
                thhe title and subtitles differently. I also inserted picture of me so
                people could have some context of what the paragraph and list were talking about. With the use of classes and ids, and normal CSS selctors 
                I applied CSS to specfic parts of the webpage like the 
                picture and text alignment in the first section, the margins of some of the pargraphs, the styling of the headers. and 
                also the outlining of the main two sections.

                       While putting in my picture for the About Me page, I had diffcutly aligning and moving the two pictures the way I wanted.
                       So with help I figured out how to inbeed CSS in HTMl to have two pictures on both sides of the section and with text in the middle. The first picture listed atuomaticly
                       goes to the left but it was not inline with the top of the section so with the inline CSS
                       I vertivally-aligned it with the top. This styling made it visually better and more fluid.
                       One problems is that if I want to add text on top of the picture it would be messed up beucase the 
                       picture is always on the top so the text will go to the left of the picture not on top.
                       Then for the second image I styled it so that it would float to the right. 
                       This allowed it to go to the right side of the page. This allowed the image to be to the right of 
                       every thing. I do not know any drawbacks of the code.

                        In the fiest section that was about me I made a unordered list about someof my favorite things.
                        When I wanted to to list my favorite foods I wanted to make a sublist under nead the list iteam "Food".
                        To do this I created an unordered list in the list iteam. This created the affect I wanted and did not have any draw backs in this application.

            <h1 class="sub-title">What choices did you have to make and how did you go about making them?</h1>
                <p class="ht">
                    Most of the choices I made were more along the line of styling it and it was really 
                    based on my personal judgement if they looked good. For example how tall or wide some of the 
                    pictures are were just me playing around with the unit. I would start maybe with 100px or something like that and I would start with 
                    that. To be honest I would go make once I was done writing the text becuase sometimes it did not look the way I wanted it.

                <p class="ht">
                   Above it the section where I talked about specfic lines of code also were some styling and organizing 
                   choices I made. Specifically I did not really know how to do the lines of code so I researched some ways
                   to do it online and then also asked for help in class.

            <h1 class="sub-title">How has this project changed your connection and understanding of HTML/CSS?</h1>
                <p class="ht">
                    This entire project has taught me how to actucally use HTML and CSS. Comeing into the project I 
                    did know a little about both languages but this project made me actucally make a product. This 
                    helped me to use specific tags to meet the requirments. It has also opene my eyes up to how many 
                    things you can do with HTML and CSS.

                <p class="ht">
                    I would probably spend more time working on the font and coloring. I did the bare minimum for it to look good 
                    but I believe I could do more in the styling aspect.
